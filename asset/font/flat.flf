flf2a$ 6 5 16 15 11 0 24463
Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai 3/93 -- based on Frank's .sig
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Modified for figlet 2.2 by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
  to add Latin-{2,3,4,5} support (Unicode U+0100-017F).
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.
